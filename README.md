# GUI

AbysmalCore's GUI is built on top of Raylib bindings for C#. It's made with customizability in mind because I'm a control freak and I like it when stuff looks good. AbysmalCore's GUI system can dynamically create a theme from a single accent color. See below:

This makes it really easy to get a good looking GUI up and running really fast
